# 📊 Sales Forecasting Using Python

Sales forecasting is a crucial aspect of business planning that helps organizations predict future sales and make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation. This project demonstrates how to build a sales forecast prediction model using Python by analyzing historical sales data and identifying underlying trends.

# 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven sales forecasting model that estimates future sales based on past performance. By leveraging statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, the model helps businesses anticipate demand and plan strategically.

**Key objectives**:

* Analyze historical sales data

* Identify trends and seasonal patterns

* Build a predictive forecasting model

* Visualize actual vs predicted sales
# 🧠 Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to accurately predict future sales due to changing customer behavior and market conditions. An inaccurate forecast can lead to overstocking, understocking, or inefficient use of resources. This project addresses these challenges by using Python-based data analysis and modeling techniques to generate reliable sales predictions.
# 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python – Core programming language

* Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing

* NumPy – Numerical computations

* Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

* Scikit-learn – Machine learning models

* XGBoost - Machine learning model

# 🔍 Methodology

**1. Data Collection** – Load historical sales data

**2. Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values and outliers

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify trends and seasonality

**4. Feature Engineering** – Prepare features for modeling

**5. Model Building** – Train forecasting models

**6. Evaluation** – Measure accuracy using metrics like RMSE and MAE

**7. Visualization** – Compare actual vs predicted sales

# 📌 Future Improvements

* Incorporate advanced models (LSTM, Prophet)

* Add external factors such as promotions and holidays

* Deploy the model as a web application

* Automate real-time forecasting
